        <p>It was only in the 1960s that the term “soul food” was first coined to reference the traditional African-American cuisine that originated in the South. Soul food is a type of cuisine where the dishes are all made differently depending on what state, what county or even what family one lives in. The cuisine has evolved to encompass everything from original recipes to vegan varieties to heart-healthy dishes and more, but the versatility of the ingredients and the visual representation of so many languages, cultures and origins on a single plate is what really keeps the soul in soul food.</p>
